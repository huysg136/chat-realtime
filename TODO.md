# TODO: Debug Announcement Modal Display Issue

- [x] Add debugging logs to appProvider.js in the announcements useEffect to log user role, fetched announcements, unseen announcement detection, and visibility state changes.
- [ ] Run the app and check console logs when an announcement should show to identify why the modal isn't displaying.
- [ ] If logs reveal issues (e.g., user role not 'user', targeting mismatch), adjust the logic accordingly.
- [ ] Verify modal rendering and integration if needed.
